Decoding Oregon Scientific wireless sensor data with RTL-SDR and GNU Radio
===========================================================================

This script decodes the packets that Oregon Scientific remote
thermometers (like the one pictured below) send to the display unit. It also
serves as example code for accessing [rtl-sdr][] / GNU Radio samples live from
Python.

Each sensor transmits every 30 seconds on 433.9MHz. The packet is repeated
twice. Modulation is [On-off keying][ook], and the 32 data bits are
[manchester encoded][manchester]. Alexander Yerezeyev implemeted a
[decoder for AVR][avr-code] microcontrollers, and wrote up a
[description of the protocol][alyer].

My sensors use the V1 protocol, but if you have newer sensors, take a look at
[JeeLabs' description][jeelabs-v2] of the V2 protocol. It would probably be
simple to adapt my code.

The GNU Radio [osmosdr block] captures from the [device][p160].
It's tuned slightly to the side to avoid the DC noise at the local oscillator
frequency. A `freq_xlating_fir_filter_ccc` block selects and downsamples the
correct region of the captured frequency range. Then it AM demodulates that band, and
uses a message sink and queue to bring the samples into Python.
(see [gr\_queue.py][gr-queue]). A Python state machine detects the preamble,
manchester-decodes the bits, and then parses the packet.

You can also (with the `-a` flag) play the AM audio to your speakers. The sensor
packets sound like beeps, and you can hear other devices transmitting on the ISM
band.
